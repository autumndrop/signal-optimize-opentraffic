# signal-optimize-opentraffic
# The FastFunction.py can create the by-turn traffic signal performance metric based on the GPS data obtained through the Open Traffic platform collaborated between the World Bank and Grab. 
# Upon the creation of the metric, signal timing plans could be adjusted iteratively to improve the mobility performance (i.e., delay).
# Detailed algorithm of creating the metric and adjusting the signal plans could be found in the attached TRR paper.
